Hello! I'm Abdullah Waleed (A.H.W.D).

I created this Splunk cheatsheet because when I was studying, I wished for a guide that was both clear and visually engaging. After a lot of work on AI template refining the design and code, this is the result.

My goal was to build a resource that helps you learn Splunk's SPL commands without being boring. It's designed to be straightforward and colorful to make your study sessions more effective.

This is a living document, and I will continue to update it with more commands as I go.

Enjoy the cheatsheet! ^_^
